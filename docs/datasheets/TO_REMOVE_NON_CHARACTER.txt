This list identifies datasheets in docs/datasheets/ that are not character-type VFD displays or controllers.
They are candidates for removal to keep this library focused on text/character VFDs.

- IV-18.pdf
  Reason: VFD numeric tube (7‑segment style). Segment anodes only; not a 5x7 character matrix, no DDRAM/CGRAM.

- 52dfa14fe34e24792f7c5408.pdf (Princeton PT6324 VFD Driver/Controller)
  Reason: Segment/digit driver (24 segments x up to 16 digits), no character generator, no 5x7 character grid.

Notes
- All Noritake CUxxxx and Matrix Orbital MOP‑AVxxx PDFs scanned are character‑type (5x7) modules using HD44780‑like control; keep.
- X-Board Hardware Manual.pdf and Economy Series Manual.pdf are support docs for alphanumeric displays; not display/controller datasheets.
