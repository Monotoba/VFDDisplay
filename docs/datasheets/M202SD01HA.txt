THE BASIC FUNCTION

Low level (0V)

High level (5V)

non connection

Low to high transition
RXD (Serial input)

When the data is being written in, the BUSY signal is active which

indicates that the module is processing data.

(When data is under processing, the BUSY signal is high “H”.)

In case of parallel input, data or control command is to be written

at the low-to-high transition of WR(L—H), when SEL=low “L”,

and TEST =high “H”.

The display character from follows equivalent to JIS-6220 (Alphabets

Katakanas and Symbols etc.).

After a character is written in, the write-in position will be shifted to the

right one digit automatically.

The above action can be executed, only when the BUSY signal is

low “L”.

 
3-2. CONTROL CODE
The control codes are available as follows.
The details will be explained from the next page.

Write-in position will be shifted to the right after new character data is

written-in.

A character data is written-in to the right end of 2nd row, the write-in

position will move to the left end of Ist row.

Then new character data is written-in to the left end of 1st row, all

displayed characters will be cleared except new one.
(1) DIM (Dimming)

The brightness can be controlled into six levels by using this function.
After writing 04H, the following dimming data is written to change the
brightness out put.

(2)BS (Back Space)

The write-in position is shifted to the left one digit, and the character
previously displayed on the digit will be cleared.

When the write-in position is on the most significant digit of the

second row, the write-in position moves to the least significant digit of the
first row,

When the write-in position is on the most significant digit of the first row,
the write-in position moves to the least significant digit of the second row.

(3) HT (Horizontal Tab)

The write-in position is shifted to the right one digit.

When the write-in position is on the least significant digit of the first row,
the write-in position will move to the most significant digit of the

second row.

When the write-in position is on the least significant digit of the

second row, the write-in position will move to the most significant digit

of the first row.
(4) CLR (Clear)

All the characters displayed are erased, the write-in position moves to the
most significant digit of the first row.
But the Dimming level and Cursor Mode are kept.

(5)DP (Display Position)

Instead of writing a character from the first digit, the write-in starting
position can be pointed by using this function.

After writing LOHEX to prepare the module for this command, another
HEX byte is written to specify the position desired.

The most significant digit The least significant digit
lst row 00 HEX 13 HEX
2nd row 14 HEX 27 HEX

(6)DC (Cursor Mode):
After writing L7HEX, another HEX byte mentioned under is written to

change the cursor mode.

The cursor is always displayed at the write-in position.

The cursor is formed by the Sdots located the bottom of 5X7 dot matrix
character font.

The cursor will be displayed as an over writing mode and the behavior of
the cursor under the lighting mode and blinking mode are explained below.

@ lighting mode
When the non displayed position is assigned as a write-in position, the
cursor will be displayed there.
But, the position that already one of the character located is assigned,
this character will be eliminated and the cursor will be displayed.
@® blinking mode
The cursor will be repeated ON and OFF every 0.3 second when the non
displayed position is selected for the write-in position.
And the position of the character already located is selected is selected (as a
write-in position), the character and the cursor will be displayed alternately.

@ no lighting mode
The no lighting mode means that the cursor will not be displayed.
When the power is turned on, no lighting mode will be selected

automatically.
Therefore, if the cursor is required, DC command shall be sent to select

the cursor lighting or blinking mode.

(7) ALD (All Display)

The full dots in all digits are displayed.
The dimming level is set for 100%.
To release this mode, the module is turned off or the RST command

shall be written.

(8) RST (Reset)

Resetting the module.

All the characters displayed are erased, then the write-in position will be
set on the most significant digit of the first row.

The displaying status is the same as the power on reset, and cursor mode is
set for no lighting mode, the dimming level is set for 100%.

3-3. SELF-TEST

When the TEST terminal is kept into “L” (connector pin #16 to be
connected to GND.)the SELF-TEST starts.

Then the display shows characters, Alphabets, and symbols, in that order.
Forty (2X20) characters are displayed at a time.

Using this mode, neither data write-in nor control code write-in is allowed.

To release this mode, TEST must be set to “H”.
3-4. POWER ON RESET

When the module is turned, the display and the meimory are cleared

and the module is initialized.

The cursor mode is set for no lighting mode, and the dimming level

is set for 100%.

When an external reset function is required, please contact Futaba sales office

for further information.

3-5. SELECTION OF INPUT MODE

TABLE-11 shows the combination of the signal lines for the parallel
or serial input.

It is needed to choose one of the combinations before operation.
Unused signal lines are to be open (internally pulled up).

In case of serial input, it is possible to choose four kinds of baud rate

by J1~J2, as shown below.

4-2. WRITE-IN TIMING (See FIG.2)

Please be sure the BUSY signal is into “L”, when the data will

 

be written in.
In case of the serial input, the module accepts the 10 bit data
string as a data, first “L” level data as a start bit, 2nd to 9th

data as an input data and the last “H” level data as a stop bit.

When these data are not received exactly, they will be ignored and
not displayed on the module.

6. OPERATING RECOMMENDATIONS

6-1. Avoid applying excessive shock or vibration beyond the specification
for this module.

6-2. Since VFDs are made of glass material, careful handling is important.

6-3. Applying lower voltage than the specified may cause non activation for
selected pixels.
Conversely, higher voltage may cause non-selected pixel to be
activated.
If such a phenomenon is observed, check the voltage level of the
power supply.

6-4. Avoid plugging or unplugging the interface connection with
the power on.

10-5. If the start up time of the supply voltage is slow, the controller
may not be reset.
The supply voltage must be risen up to the specified voltage level
within 30msec.

10-6. Avoid using the module where excessive noise interference is expected.
Noise affects the interface signal and causes improper operation.
Keep the length of the interface cable less than 50cm (When the longer
cable is required, please contact FUTABA engineering.).

10-7. When power supply is turned off, the capacitor does not discharge
immediately.
The high voltage applied to the VFD must not contact the controller
IC. (The shorting of the mounted components within 30seconds after
power off may cause damage.)

REMARKS

This specification is subject to change without prior notice in order to

improve the design and quality,
Your consultation with our engineer is recommended for the use of

this module.
