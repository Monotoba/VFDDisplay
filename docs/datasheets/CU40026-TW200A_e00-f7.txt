DC3 : Device Control 3 (13 Hex) «** Horizontal Scroll mode

Alternative LINE ENDING MODE is specified by DC1, DC2 and DC3 when character data or
BS or HT or LF is written. Just after power on or initialize, DC1 is selected (Default Mode).
CU40026-TW200A

7.2.9 DC4 : Device Control 4 (14 Hex) -*- Cursor is displayed on underline.(Default)
DC5 : Device Control 5 (15 Hex) -:- Cursor is displayed as a blinking all dot character.
DC6 : Device Control 6 (16 Hex) --- Cursor is turned to invisible.

DC7 : Device Control 7 (17 Hex) --- Cursor is displayed as a blinking Underline.
Above four codes control the cursor rendition. DC4 is default mode. The mode is maintained
until other mode is selected. The blinking speed can be varied by ESC sequence. (see para.
7.2.10 ESC)

7.2.10 CTO : Character Table 0 (18 Hex) -:- International character font
CT1 : Character Table 1 (19 Hex) --- KATAKANA character font

Above two codes select Character Table. Just after power on, CTO is selected(Default Mode ).
Any characters from those 2 tables can be displayed on the screen by the bank selection.

EUR: Euro Currency mark (1AH) :** Euro Currency mark
Euro Currency mark is stored instead of Blank in character code location AD Hex of CTO.
This is replaced to Blank if CTO is selected again, and it affect displayed character of AD Hex.

7.2.11 ESC : Escape (1B Hex)
The character or data strings succeeding of ESC code control the various functions such as
user definable font, cursor addressing, screen luminance control, selection of data writing
mode, blink speed control and initialize.

(1) User Definable Font (UDF)

Users desired fonts can be defined by software. The fonts will be memorized in RAM of the
CPU.

Syntax : ESC (1B Hex) + "C" (43 Hex) + CHR + PT1 + PT2+PT3+PT4+PT5

Any 5x7 dot patterns consisted of data from PT1 thru PT5 can be stored in character code
location specified by CHR.

Maximum number of UDF are 16 characters at once. Storing more than 16 will kill the oldest
font. However, within the 16 character codes where already defined by UDF, the over-write-
latest font replaces the former font.

1st byte : ESC(1B Hex)
2nd byte :"C"(43 Hex)
3rd byte ‘ CHR(00 Hex to FF Hex)

Specify the character code location from 00 Hex to FF Hex by CHR.
If CHR overlaps the control codes such as BS, HT, etc. , the control function will
be lost. And therefore, the overlap to the ESC code may not avail further UDF.

Ath to 8th byte : PT 1 through PT5
Specify ON or OFF of 36 dot position (5x7 dot + Underline).
Following table shows the relation of dot position and the data formation ("1" = dot
turn on, "0" = dot turn off)

Then Syntax should be written : 1B + 43 + AO + 84 + 10 + 02 + 00 + 01 (Hex)

(2) Cursor Moving
The cursor can be moved to any position of the screen by following ESC sequence.

Syntax : ESC (1B Hex) + "H" (48 Hex) + 1 Byte data

Data = 50 Hex to FF Hex : The cursor doesn't move.

(3) Luminance Control
The screen luminance can be varied by following ESC sequence.
Just after power on, the screen luminance is set to 100%.

Syntax : ESC (1B Hex) +" L" (4C Hex) + 1 Byte data

Data= 00 Hexto3F Hex: approx. 25%
40 Hexto7F Hex: approx. 50%
80 HextoBF Hex: approx. 75%
CO HextoFF Hex: 100%
CU40026-TW200A

(4) Selection of Writing Mode
Flicker less Mode can be selected by following ESC sequence.

Syntax : ESC (1B Hex) + "S" (53 Hex) «= Flicker less Mode

Within Flicker less Mode, although BUSY might become longer, flicker less-high speed-
continuous-data write can be achieved since refreshing of the screen has priority over the
data acceptance.

Quick data write with minimum BUSY time will be given by Quick Write Mode since the
data acceptance has the priority over the refreshing of the screen.
Within this mode, continuous high speed data write may cause flicker display.

Note :

When serial data write with high speed baud rate at Flickerless Mode, it may have the
read error of the data. Busy check within Flickerless Mode or setting to the Quick Write
Mode is recommended for serial data write.

Just after power on or initialize, Quick Write Mode is selected until other mode is set. After
selected Flickerless Mode, Quick Write Mode can't be selected unless otherwise initialize.

(5) Blink Speed Control
Blinking speed of cursor can be varied by following ESC sequence.

Syntax : ESC (1B Hex) + "T" (54 Hex) + 1 Byte Data

Data =00 Hex «=: 256
FF Hex ==" 255
FE Hex === 254
01 Hex ==: 1

Period of Blinking = Data Value x Approx.30 mS
At power on default, 20 (14 Hex) is set to data.

(6) Initialize
All displayed characters and all setting factors are cleared by following ESC sequence.

Syntax : ESC (1B Hex) + "I" (49 Hex)
Execution of above sequence, module is reset as just after power on.

7.3 Test Mode
Test Mode is set by keeping SIN (TO) is low for more than 100mS at power on or initialize.
During Test Mode, all character fonts are displayed automatically, and no any data are
acceptable.

Notice for the Cautious Handling VFD Modules

Handling and Usage Precautions:
Please carefully follow the appropriate product application notes for proper usage, safety handling, and operation standards for
maximum performance.

[VFD tubes are made of glass]

e Because the edges of the VFD glass-envelop are not smooth, it is necessary to handle carefully to avoid injuries to your
hands
Please avoid breaking the VFD glass-envelop to prevent injury from sharp glass particles.
The tip of the exhaust pipe is fragile so avoid shock from impact.
It is recommended to allow sufficient open space surrounding the exhaust pipe to avoid possible damage.
Please design the PCB for the VFD-module within 0.3 mm warping tolerance to avoid any forces that may damage the
display due to PCB distortion causing a breakdown of the electrical circuit leading to VFD failure.
[High voltage]

e Avoid touching conductive electrical parts, because the VFD-module uses high voltage exceeding approx.35 volts.

° Even when electric power is turned off, it may take more than one minute for the electrical current to discharge.
[Electrostatic charge]

e \VFD-modules needs electrostatic free packaging and protection from electrostatic charges during handling and usage.
[Structure]

e During operation, VFD and VFD-modules generate heat. Please consider sufficient heat radiation dissipation using

heat sink solutions.
e We prefer to use UL grade materials or components in conjunction with VFD-modules.
e Wrap and twist motion causes stress and may break VFDs & VFD modules. Please adhere to allowances within
0.3mm at the point of attachment.

[Power]

e Apply regulated power to the VFD-module within specified voltages to protect from failures.

e Because some VFD-modules may consume in rush current equal to twice the typical current at power-on timing,

we recommend using a sufficient power capability and quick starting of the power regulator.

e VFD-module needs a specified voltage at the point of connection. Please use an adequate power cable to avoid a
decrease in voltage. We also recommend inserting a power fuse for extra protection.

[Operating consideration]

e = Illuminating phosphor will decrease in brightness during extended operation. If a fixed pattern illuminates for an
extended period,( several hours), the phosphor efficiency will decrease compared to the non operating phosphor
causing a non uniform brightness among pixels. Please consider programming the display patterns to use all phosphor
segments evenly. Scrolling may be a consideration for a period of time to refresh the phosphor condition and improve
even illumination to the pixels.

e Werecommend using a signal cable 30cm or less to avoid some possible disturbances to the signal.

[Storage and operating environment]
e Please use VFD-modules under the recommended specified environmental conditions. Salty, sulfur and dusty
environments may damage the VFD-module even during storage.
[Discard]
e Some VFDs contain a small amount of cadmium in the phosphor and lead in the solder. When discarding VFDs or
VFD-modules, please adhere to governmental related laws or regulations.
[Others]

e Although the VFD-module is designed to be protected from electrical noise, please plan your circuitry to exclude as
much noise as possible.

e Donot reconstruct or repair the VFD-module without our authorization. We cannot assure the quality or reliability of

unauthorized reconstructed VFD-modules.

Notice:

«We do not authorize the use of any patents that may be inherent in these specifications.

«Neither whole nor partial copying of these specifications are permitted without our approval.
If necessary , please ask for assistance from our sales consultant.

«This product is not designed for military, aerospace, medical or other life-critical applications. If you choose to use this product for
