FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
OSCILLATION CIRCUIT

An oscillation circuit may be constructed by connecting external Resistor (R1) and Capacitor (C1) between the oscillator
pins -- OSCO and OSCI. The RC time constant depends on the value of VDD voltage used. The target oscillation
frequency is 2MHz. Please refer to the diagram below.

Note: When data is written into the RAM (DCRAM, ADRAM, CGRAM) in a continuous manner, the address are automatically incremented. Therefore
it is not necessary to specify the first byte of the 2nd and later bytes when writing the RAM data.

When the CSB pin is set to "LOW" Level, data transfer operation is enabled. 8 bits of data are sequentially inputted into
the DIN Pin (LSB first). The shift clock is inputted into CLKB pin and the shift register reads the data at rising edge of the
shift clock. The internal load signals are automatically generated and the data is written to each register and RAM. Thus,
it is not necessary to input load signals externally.

When the CSB Pin is set to "HIGH" Level, the data transfer operation is disabled. The data input when the CSB Pin
changes from "HIGH" to "LOW' is recognized in 8-bit units.

COMMANDS

The following are the list of commands issued by PT6302. When data is written into the RAM (DCRAM, CGRAM, or

codes. The character codes specified by the DCRAM is converted to a 5 x 7 dot matrix character pattern via the CGROM
and CGRAM. The DCRAM can store up to 16 characters. The DCRAM Data Write Command Format is shown below.

CGRAM DATA WRITE COMMAND

The Character Generator RAM (CGRAM) Data Write Command is used to specify the CGRAM address (00H to 07H)
and write the character pattern data. It consists of 3 address bits which is used to store the 5 x 7 dot matrix character
patterns. The CGRAM can store up to 8 types of character patterns which may be displayed by specifying the Character

GENERAL OUTPUT PORT SET COMMAND

The General Output Port Set Command is used to specify the general output port status. The general output port is used
to control other input/output devices as well as turn on the LED Display. When the general output port is set to "HIGH",
the output is equivalent to the VDD voltage. When the general output port is set to "LOW" Level, the output becomes

ground potential. The command format is given below.

DISPLAY DUTY SET COMMAND

The Display Duty Set Command is used to write the display duty value to the duty cycle register. Using a 3-bit data, the
display duty adjusts the contrast in 8 stages. When the power is turned ON or when the RSTB signal is inputted, the duty
cycle register value is set to "0". It is advisable to always execute this command before turning on the display, after which
the desired duty value may be set. The command format is given below.

NUMBER OF DIGITS SET COMMAND

The Number of Digits Set Command is used to write the number of display digits into the display digit register. Using a
3-bit data, the Number of Digits Set Command can display 9 to 16 digits. When the power is turned ON or when the

RSTB signal is inputted, the value is set to "0". It is advisable to always execute this command before the turning on the
display. The command format is given below.

DISPLAY LIGHT SET COMMAND

The Display Light Set Command is used to turn all display lights ON or OFF. All Display Lights ON Mode is primarily
used for testing the display. The All Display Light OFF Mode is used for the blinking display and to prevent any
malfunction when the power is turned ON. The general output port cannot be controlled by this command. The command
