1.0 INTRODUCTION

This module consists of an 80-character VFD (4 rows of 20 characters), driver circuitry, bus interface,
DC/DC-AC converter and character generator. Communication with the module is via an 8-bit parallel
data bus with chip-select, write, and busy control lines, or via asynchronous serial communications

(19200BPS, 8 data bits, even parity, one stop bit) with a busy handshake.

4.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
4.1 GENERAL
Upon power up, the module resets to the following state:

Display cleared

Cursor set to position 1 (left most character) of row 1

Display mode set to character overwrite (DC1) and invisible cursor (DC4)
Brightness set to 100%

Blink speed set to 14H

Character table 0 selected (CTO)

Quick write mode selected.

Data is written to the module in either parallel or serial format. Data should only be sent to the module
while the BUSY signal is low. In parallel format, data is written to the module on the rising edge of the
WR* pulse while CS* is low. The module sets the BUSY line after data is latched and clears the line
after the data is processed. In serial format, data is written to the module least significant bit (LSB) first.
The module sets the BUSY line after the stop bit is sent and clears the line after the data is processed.
The length of time that the busy line is set depends upon the data that is sent. Refer to section 3.7 for
specific bus timing.

Since the module is in quick write mode upon power up there may be times when the display flickers
during high-speed data transmission. This is because in the quick write mode the communications have
the highest priority resulting in a minimum busy signal. This flicker can be avoided by selecting the
flickerless mode of operation (see section 4.4.4).

4.2 CHARACTER DATA

Standard character data is from 20H to FFH (see section 7.0). User defined characters can exist at any
location from 00H to FFH. Writing data from 20H to FFH or a user-defined character will result in the
corresponding character being displayed at the current cursor position. The horizontal tab command (see
section 4.3.2) is then executed.

4.3 COMMAND DATA
Command data is in the range of 00H to 1FH.
4.3.1 BS: BACKSPACE (08H)

The cursor position is moved one position to the left. At the left most character position of rows 2 - 4
the cursor will move to the right most character position of the row above it. At the left most character
position of row | the cursor will not move.

4.3.2 HT: HORIZONTAL TAB (09H)

The cursor position is shifted to the right one position. At the right end of a row the cursor moves to the
left end of the next lower row. At the right end of the bottom row the cursor movement depends upon
DC1 and DC2 modes as follows:

DC1 Mode:
The cursor moves from the right end of the bottom row to the left end of the top row.

DC2 Mode:
The contents of the each row are shifted up one row. Data in the first row is lost. The bottom row is
cleared and the cursor is placed at the left most position of the bottom row.

4.3.3 LF: LINE FEED (OAH)

The cursor is shifted to the same column position of the next lower row. At the bottom row movement
depends upon DC1 or DC2 modes.

DC1 Mode:
The cursor moves to the same column position of the top row.

DC2 Mode:
The contents of the each row are shifted up one row. Data in the first row is lost. The bottom row is
cleared and the cursor remains at the same position.

4.3.4 FF: FORM FEED (0CH)

The cursor moves to the left end of the top row.

4.3.5 CR: CARRIAGE RETURN (0DH)

4.4 ESCAPE COMMANDS

The following commands are executed by first writing the escape character (1BH) followed by one or
more bytes.

4.4.1 USER DEFINABLE CHARACTER (1BH + 43H + CHR + B4 + BS + B6 + B7 + B8)

Two user definable characters (UDC) are available. Any 5x7 pattern of pixels can be stored at the
character location identified by CHR, which can be any value from 00H to FFH. Assignment of a UDC
to a specific character code will cause that character or function to be replaced with the UDC. Only two
UDCs can be defined at one time. Defining additional UDCs will cause the oldest UDC to revert back
to its original character or function. If the escape command (1BH) is redefined power must be removed
to restore the function. Bytes 4 through 8 (B4 ... B8) specify the specific UDC according to figure 4.
Setting a bit = 1 turns on the pixel while setting the bit = 0 leaves it off (* = do not care).

UDC Example: Define a UDC at location A2H, the UDC is a dash (-). The pixels that need to be turned
on are P16 - P20. The command sequence is:

1BH + 43H + A2H + 00H + 80H + OFH + 00H + OOH.

4.4.2 MOVE CURSOR (1BH + 48H + DATA)

The cursor position can be set to any display position by sending escape (1BH), move cursor command
(48H), and then a parameter byte identifying a specific cursor location according to the following chart:

3 28H | 29H | 2AH | 2BH | --- | 3BH
4 3CH | 3DH | 3EH | 3FH | --- | 4FH

 

 

DATA values of 50H to FFH are invalid and do not cause the cursor to move.

4.4.33 LUMINANCE CONTROL (1BH + 4CH + DATA)

Display luminance can be set to one of the following four levels by sending escape (1BH), luminance

control command (4CH), and then a luminance byte.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DATA LUMINANCE
OOH to 3FH 25%
40H to 7FH 50%
80H to BFH 75%
COH to FFH | 100% (Default)

 

 

4.4.4 FLICKERLESS MODE (1BH + 53H)

Flickerless mode is selected by sending 1BH + 53H. Flickerless mode makes updating the display the
highest priority of the module and as such will extend the busy time for many commands. Serial
communication cannot be used in the flickerless mode. Once flickerless mode is selected, the module
must be powered down or sent a software initialization command (see section 4.4.6) to reenter the quick

write mode.

4.4.5 BLINK SPEED CONTROL (1BH + 54H + DATA)

The blinking speed of the cursor (an all on character) can be controlled in 30ms increments. The period
of the blinking cursor equals the multiplying value (represented by DATA) times 30ms.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DATA | Multiplying value
00H 256
01H l
02H 2
FFH 255

 

 

The power up default blink speed value (DATA) ts 14H.

4.4.6 INITIALIZATION (1BH + 49H)

The initialization command performs the following:

Clears Display and UDC Memory

Sets Cursor to position | (left most character) of row 1
Sets Display Modes to character overwrite (DC1) and invisible cursor (DC4)

Sets Brightness to 100%

Stops Blinking and sets Blink Speed to 14H

Selects Character table 0 (CTO)

5.0 TEST MODE

The test mode can be entered by holding the SIN/SELFTEST™* pin low for more than 100ms at power up
or during software initialization. See section 3.8 for more information about the power up reset timing.
During the test mode all characters of character table 0 are sequentially displayed and no communication
data will be accepted. The mode is exited by disconnecting power from the module.
