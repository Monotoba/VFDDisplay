INSTRUCTION MANUAL

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 

Futaba Vacuum Fluorescent display Module M204SDO01AA,with
VFD 204-SD-01G display,produces 20 digits on 4 rows.

Each character is displayed in 5X7 dot matrix.

Consisting of a VFD,microcomputer,driver IC,the module
can be connected directly to the system bus,thus
simplifying interfacing.

The bright and aesthetically pleasing VFD makes the
module desireable for an application in office equipments,

TABLE~4 THE BASIC FUNCTIONS

When the data is being written in, the BUSY signal is active which

indicates that the module is processing the data.

(When the data is under processing, the BUSY signal is high “1”.)

 

The data or control command is to be wrtttenm in at the rising edge of

WR(0—-1), when SEL= “0”, and TEST=high “1”.

The display character form follows equivalent to ASCII (Alphabet, Numerics

and Symbols etc.).

After a character is uritten in, the write-in position will be shifted

to the right one digit automatically.

The above action can be executed, only when the BUSY signal is low

5) OPERATING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Avoide applying excessive shock or vibration beyond the specification

for this wodule.
2, Since VFDs are made of glass material, careful handling is important.

3. Applying lower voltage than specified may cause non activation for the

selected pixels.
Conversely, higher voltage may cause non-selected pixelsto be activiated

[f users observe the above phenomenon, check the voltage level of the

power supply.

4, Avoid plugging or unplugging the interface connection with the power on,

5.If the start up time of the supply voltage is slow, the CPU way not
be reset. The supply voltage must be risen up to a specified voltage

level within 30msec,

& . When power supply is turned on, such as 5A, imsec of rush current «may

flow, because DC/DC converter {is equipped on the module.

7. fivoid using the module where excessive noise interference is expected.
Noise affects the interface signal and causes improper operation,
Keep the length of the interface cable less than SQcm (When the longer

cable is required, please contact FUTABA engineering.) .

8. When power supply is turned off, the capacitor isn’t discharged immediately.
The high voltage applied to the VFD must not contact the controiler IC.
{The shorting of the mounted components within 30sec. after power off may

cause damage .}

REMARKS :

This specification is subject to change without prior notice in order to improve

the design and quality.
Your consultation with our engineer is recommended for the use of this module,

It is recommended to store these definable characters at the initializing of module.

All these data will remain into the RAM and the cliant can display user’s original font on

There is no back-up system of this RAM, therefore, it is needed to restore these data when
power off,

(3) BS ( Back Space ) :
The write-in position is shifted to the left one digit.
(beyond this point, the position of write-in position is identical with
write-in position of the display, unless otherwise specified. Under DC8 MODE,
the write-in position will not show up.)
When the write-in position is on the most significant digit of the third
row, the write-in position moves to the least significant digit of the
second row,
When the write-in position is on the most significant digit of the first

row, the wtite-in position moves to the least significant digit of the

fourth row,

(4) LF ( Line Feed ) :
When the write-in position is in the fourth row, the character displayed

second to fourth row, is shifted up, leaving the write-in position at its
present position, then the fourth row is cleared,

When the write-in position is in first to third row, the write-in position

moves down to under row staying on the same line.

CR ( Carriage Return ) :

The write-in position moves to the most significant digit of the same rows,
DP ( Display Position ) :

Instead of writing the character from the first digit, the write-in starting
position can be pointed by using this function.

After writing IOHEX to prepare module for this command, another HEX byte

is written to specify the position desired.

A third byte representing data is then sent.

DC1 (Normal Display Mode ) :

Miter writing a character, the write-in position is shifted to the right

one digit automatically.

When the write-in position is on the least significant digit of the first
to therd row, the write-in position moves to the most significant digit of
the under row,

When the character is displayed on the least significant digit of the
fourth row, the write-in position is on the same digit.

And the character code is written in the module next, first, all digits are
cleared, second, the character is displayed on the most significant digit of
the first row and the write-in position moves to the next digit.

When the power is turn on, this DC1 MODE is selected, and will be held

until another mode is selected.

DC 2 ( Vertical Scroll Mode } :
After writing the characters up to the least significant digit of the
fourth row, all the characters displayed in the second to fourth row are

shifted to the upper row, clearing the fourth row.

The displaying status is the same as the hardware Reset, but the font
data of UFO~2 is kept.
