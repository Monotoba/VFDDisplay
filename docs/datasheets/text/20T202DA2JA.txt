5. FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS
5.1 Registers in VFD Controller

The VFD controller has two 8-bit registers, an instruction register (IR) and a data register (DR).

IR stores instruction codes, such as display clear and cursor shift, and address information for DD-RAM
and CG-RAM. The IR can only be written from the host MPU. DR temporarily stores data to be written
into DD-RAM or CG-RAM and temporarily stores data to be read from DD-RAM or CG-RAM. Data written
into the DR from the MPU is automatically written into DD-RAM or CG-RAM by an internal operation.
The DR is also used for data storage when reading data foom DD-RAM or CG-RAM. When address
information is written into the IR, data is read and then stored into the DR from DD-RAM or CG-RAM by
internal operation. Data transfer between MPU is then completed when the MPU reads the DR.

After the read, data in DD-RAM or CG-RAM at the next address is sent to the DR for the next read from
the MPU. By the register selector (RS) signal, these two registers can be selected (See Table 9).

Table_9. Register Selection

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RS R/W

0 0 IR write as an internal operation (display clear, etc.)

0 1 Read busy flag (DB7) and address counter (DBO to DB6)

1 0 DR write as an internal operation (DR to DDRAM or CGRAM)

1 1 DR read as an internal operation (DDRAM or CGRAM to DR)
5.1.1 Address Counter (ACC)

5.1.2

The address counter (ACC) assigns addresses to both DD-RAM and CG-RAM. When an address
of an instruction is written into the IR, the address information is sent from the IR to the ACC.
Selection of either DD-RAM or CG-RAM is also determined concurrently by the instruction.

After writing into (reading from) DD-RAM or CG-RAM, the ACC is automatically incremented by 1
(decremented by 1). The ACC contents are then output to DBO to DB6 when RS = O and

R/W = 1 (See table_9).

Display Data RAM (DD-RAM)

Display data RAM (DD-RAM) stores display data represented in 8-bit character codes.

The area in DD-RAM that is not used for display can be used as general data RAM.

See Table_10 for the relationships between DD-RAM addresses and positions on the VFD.

2nd Row | 40 Hex 41 Hex 42 Hex | weeeeee 52 Hex 53 Hex

5.1.3 Character Generator ROM (CG-ROM)

The CG-ROM generates character patterns of 5x7 dots from 8-bit character codes (Table_11).
It can generate 240 kinds of 5x7 dot character patterns. The character fonts are shown on the
following page. The character codes OOH to OFH are allocated to the CG-RAM.

5.1.4 Character Generator RAM (CG-RAM) 1,2];,3),4)5
In the character generator RAM (CG-RAM), the user can rewrite 6|7 10
character patterns by program. For 5x7 dots and cursor, eight
patterns can be written. Write into DD-RAM the character codes 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15
at the addresses shown as the left column of Table_11 to show 161171181191 20
the character patterns stored in CG-RAM. See Table_12 for the 211221 231 241 25
relationship between CG-RAM addresses and data and display
patterns and refer to Fig-8 for dot assignment of VFD. Areas 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30
that are not used for display can be used as general data RAM. 311321331 34135

Notes:1. Character code bits 0 to 2 correspond to CG-RAM address bits 3 to 5 (3 bits : 8 types).

5. 1 for CG-RAM data corresponds to display selection and 0 to non-selection.

CG-RAM address bits 0 to 2 designate the character pattern line position. The 8th line is the

cursor position and its display is formed by a logical OR with the cursor. Maintain the 8th line
data, corresponding to the cursor display position, at 0 as the cursor display.
If bit 4 of the 8th line data is 1, 1 bit will light up the cursor regardless of the cursor presence.
3. Character pattern row positions correspond to CG-RAM data bits 0 to 4 (bit 4 being at the left).
4. As shown Table-12, CG-RAM character patterns are selected when character code bits 4 to 7

are all 0. However, since character code bit 3 has no effect, the R display example above can
be selected by either character code OOH or O8H.

"x" Indicates no effect (Don't care)

5.2 Data transfer
When data written, data can be input when strobe goes "0". 1st byte is Start byte, register to
select IR or DR by RS (bit6) bit and data write or read by R/W (bit5=0) in this byte.
And next byte is instruction byte. (See Fig-9)
When data is read, to read the Busy flag + Address counter (AC6 to ACO) or to read the data
which was written in DD-RAM or CG-RAM is chosen by the start byte to input first.
Data is output at the falling edge of the shift clock (See Fig-10 and Fig-11).

6.INSTRUCTIONS

6.1 Outline

Only the instruction register (IR) and the data register (DR) of the VFD controller can be controlled by
the user's MPU. Before starting the internal operation of the controller, control information is temporarily
stored into these registers to allow interfacing with various MPUs, which operate at different speeds, or
various peripheral control devices. The internal operation of the controller is determined by signals sent
from the MPU. These signals, which include register selection signal (RS), read/write signal (R/W), and
the data bus (DBO to DB7), make up the controller instructions (See Table_14).

There are four categories of instructions that:

* Designate controller functions, such as display format, data length, etc.
* Set internal RAM addresses

* Perform data transfer with internal RAM

* Perform miscellaneous functions

Normally, instructions that perform data transfer with internal RAM are used the most.

However, auto-increment by 1 (or auto-decrement by 1) of internal RAM addresses after each data
write can lighten the program load of the MPU. Since the display shift instruction can perform
concurrently with display data write, the user can minimize system development time with maximum
programming efficiency.

The I/D bit selects the way in which the contents of the address counter (ACC) are modified after
every access to DD-RAM or CG-RAM.

I/D = 1 : The address counter (ACC) is increased.

I/D = 0 : The address counter (ACC) is decreased.

The S bit enables display shift, instead of cursor shift, after each write or read to the DD-RAM.
S = 1: Display shift enabled.
S = 0: Cursor shift enabled.

The direction in which the display is shifted is opposite in sense to that of the cursor.

For example, if S=O and |/D=1, the cursor would shift one character to the right after a MPU writes
to DD-RAM. However if S=1 and I/D=1, the display would shift one character to the left and the
cursor would maintain its position on the panel.

The cursor will already be shifted in the direction selected by I/D during reads of the DD-RAM,
irrespective of the value of S. Similarly reading and writing the CG-RAM always shift the cursor.
Also both lines are shifted simultaneously.

) If the cursor is displayed, moves the cursor to the left most character in the top line (upper line).

This instruction sets the number of display line and brightness control.
This instruction initializes the system, and must be the first instruction executed after power-on.

 

 

The N bit selects between 1-line or 2-line display.

N = 1: Select 2 line display (Using anode output A1 to A80)

N = 0: Select 1 line display (Using anode output A1 to A40. A41 to A80 fixed Low level.)
BR1, BRO flag is control to brightness of VFD to modulate pulse width of Anode output as follows.

6.2.7 Set CG-RAM Address

DB7 DB6 DBS DB4 DB3 DB2 DB1 DBO

RS = 0, RW =0

 

 

 

 

This instruction
(1) Load a new 6-bit address into the address counter (ACC).
(2) Sets the address counter (ACC) to address CG-RAM.

Once "Set CG-RAM Address" has been executed, the contents of the address counter (ACC) will be
automatically modified after every access of CG-RAM, as determined by the “Entry Mode Set” instruction.
The active width of the address counter (ACC), when it is addressing CG-RAM, is 6 bits, so the counter
will wrap around to OOH from 3FH if more than 64 bytes of data are written to CG-RAM.

6.2.8 Set DD-RAM Address

DB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 DB3 DB2 DB1 DBO

| 4 | ADD | 80H to A7H (1-Line)
RS = 0, RIW=0 COH to E7H (2-Line)

 

 

This instruction
(1) Loads a new 7-bit address into the address counter (ACC).
(2) Sets the address counter (ACC) to point to the DD-RAM.

Once the "Set DD-RAM Address" instruction has been executed, the contents of the address counter
(ACC) will be automatically modified after each access of DD-RAM, as selected by the "Entry Mode Set"
instruction.

6.2.9 Read Address
DB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 ODB3 ODB2 ~~ ODB!1 DBO
| BF=0 | ACC
RS = 0, R/W = 1

 

 

 

The next instruction will not be accepted until BF is reset to 0. Check the BF status before the next
write operation. At the same time, the value of the address counter (ACC) in binary AAAAAAA is

read out. This address counter (ACC) is used by both CG-RAM and DD-RAM addresses, and its value
is determined by the previous instruction. The address contents are the same as for instructions set
CG-RAM address and set DD-RAM address.

6.2.10 Write Data to CG or DD-RAM

DB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 DB3 DB2 ~ ODB1_ DBO
Data Write 00H to FFH

 

 

RS =1, RW =0

This instruction writes 8-bit binary data (DB7 to DBO) into CG-RAM or DD-RAM.

To write into CG-RAM or DD-RAM is determined by the previous specification of the CG-RAM or
DD-RAM address setting. After a write, the address is automatically incremented or decremented by 1
according to the entry mode. The entry mode also determines the display shift.

When data is written to the CG-RAM, the DB7, DB6 and DB5 bits are not displayed as characters.

6.2.11 Read Data from CG or DD-RAM

DB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 DB3 ODB2 ~ ODB1_ DBO
Data Read

 

 

RS = 1, R/W = 1

This instruction reads 8-bit binary data (DB7 to DBO) from CG-RAM or DD-RAM.

The previous designation determines whether CG-RAM or DD-RAM is to be read.

Before entering this read instruction, either CG-RAM or DD-RAM address set instruction must be
executed. If not executed, the first read data will be invalid. When serially executing read instructions,
the next address data is normally read from the second read. The address set instructions need not
be executed just before this read instruction when shifting the cursor by the cursor shift instruction
(when reading out DD-RAM).

The operation of the cursor shift instruction is the same as the set DD-RAM address instruction.

After a read, the entry mode automatically increases or decreases the address by 1.

Note : The address counter (ACC) is automatically increased or decreased by 1 after the write instructions
to CG-RAM or DD-RAM are executed. The RAM data selected by the ACC cannot be read out at this
time even if read instructions are executed. Therefore, to correctly read data, execute either the address
set instruction or cursor shift instruction (only with DD-RAM), then just before reading the desired data,
execute the read instruction from the second time the read instruction is sent.

7.OPERATING RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1 Avoid applying excessive shock or vibration beyond the specification for the VFD module.

7.2 Since VFDs are made of glass material, careful handling is required.
i.e. Direct impact with hard material to the glass surface(especially exhaust tip) may crack
the glass.

7.3 When mounting the VFD module to your system, leave a slight gap between the VFD glass
and your front panel.
The module should be mounted without stress to avoid flexing of the PCB.

7.4 Avoid plugging or unplugging the interface connection with the power on, otherwise it may
cause the severe damage to input circuitry.

7.5 Exceeding any of maximum ratings may cause the permanent damage.

7.6 Since the VFD modules contain high voltage source, careful handling is required during
powered on.

7.7 When the power is turned off, the capacitor does not discharge immediately.
The high voltage applied to the VFD must not contact to the ICs. And the short-circuit of
mounted components on PCB within 30 seconds after power-off may cause damage to those.

7.8 The power supply must be capable of providing at least 3 times the rated current, because
the surge current can be more than 3 times the specified current consumption when the
power is turned on.

7.9 Avoid using the module where excessive noise interference is expected. Noise may affects
the interface signal and causes improper operation. And it is important to keep the length of

the interface cable less than 50cm.

7.10 Since all VFD modules contain C-MOS ICs, anti-static handling procedures are always required.
