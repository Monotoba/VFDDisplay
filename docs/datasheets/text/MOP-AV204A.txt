Features

The Matrix Orbital Parallel display series offers a low cost display solution utilizing an industry standard
communication interface for simple integration into a wide variety of new and existing applications. The
luminous text with configurable brightness and a variety of filter options allow the MOP Vacuum
Florescent Display line to offer a robust yet stylish display solution for any project. The standard
alphanumeric font set also allows up to eight custom characters to be saved in display Random Access
Memory for a custom design touch.

Instructions

Outline

The MOP line is controlled using a standard HD44780 compliant controller. The display is enabled by
pulling the Chip Enable (E) pin high, communication to and from the device is controlled using the
Read/Write (R/W) input, and one of two available 8-bit registers are selected via the Register Select (RS)
line. Using Register Select, either the Instruction Register (IR) or Data Register (DR) is selected by
toggling RS low or high respectively.

While executing from the IR, the display will pull the Most Significant Bit of the data bus, DB7, high.
While this Busy Flag (BF) is set, any instructions sent to the unit will be ignored. The status of this flag
and the current position of the Address Counter (AC) can be obtained by performing a read operation on
the instruction register at any time.

ap

0 IR write as an internal operation (display clear, etc.)
; 1 Read busy flag (DB7) and address counter (DBO to DB6)
1 0 Write data to DDRAM or CGRAM (DR to DDRAM or CGRAM)
1 1 Read data from DDRAM or CGRAM (DDRAM or CGRAM to DR)

When writing for the DR, one of two locations can be chosen using the AC. The value provided to the AC
when executing a set address command differentiates these locations. The AC is automatically
decremented or incremented after a read or a write.

DDRAM provides eighty bytes of display memory to all displays. Memory outside the bounds of the
display area can be used as general RAM. DDRAM addressing begins at the top left of the display with a
value of 0, addresses then increment from left to right then down once a row is filled.

CGRAM provides eight custom characters that can be created by writing to CGRAM locations then
displayed using the first eight CGROM character codes, as seen in the character ROM table below.

Characters are sent to the display by performing a write operation on the DR using the correct character
address within CGROM. Instructions are issued by writing to the IR; a complete list is available below.

Description

  

Write “20H” to all DDRAM locations, set
DDRAM address to “OOH”, return cursor
to its original position, and set I/D to “1”.
Set DDRAM address to “OOH” and return
cursor to its original position if shifted.
The contents of DDRAM are not changed.
Assign cursor moving direction and enable
the shift of entire display. DDRAM and
CRAM addresses are incremented and
cursor moves right when I/D is set to “1”,
the opposite is true when reset to “0”.
Setting SH to “1” causes the entire display
to shift affecting only DDRAM.

Set display (D), and blinking of cursor (B)
on/off control bit. Setting D or B to “1”
will cause the display or blinking cursor to
turn on; the opposite is true for reset.
Set cursor moving and display shift control
bit, and the direction, without changing of
DDRAM data. Setting S/L to “1” will shift
the screen horizontally while the opposite
will move the cursor through all screen
positions. Setting R/L to “1” will shift right
immediately. AC and DDRAM are not
altered.

Set interface data length. Setting DL to
“LW” specifies 8-bit mode, “O” 4-bit.

Set CGRAM address in address counter.

Set DDRAM address in address counter.

Read the status of the display controller
through the BF Bit. The contents of
address counter can also be read.

Write data into internal RAM
(DDRAM/CGRAWM), location is determined
by the AC. AC and display shift are
adjusted as specified.

Read data from internal RAM
(DDRAM/CGRAM}, location is determined
by the AC, set command is recommended
previous to this. Only AC is adjusted.
Character ROM

The character generator ROM stores up to two hundred fifty-six 5x7 dot character patterns from 8-bit
character codes. The first sixteen characters are reserved for custom characters saved in CGRAM.

Character RAM

CGRAM allows the creation of up to eight 5x7 character patterns. Eight bytes are assigned to each
character address, the least significant five bits of which represent the five pixel columns. Pixels are
activated by setting the bit in their position in CGRAM to “1”.

Each character has eight addresses in CGRAM corresponding to each of its eight pixel rows. The highest
three bits represent the character address in DDRAM. The lowest three bits of this address represent
the row positions beginning with 0 at the top.

Finally, each character can be referenced in DDRAM and written to the screen using its eight bit
character code. Note that each character is addressable by two codes.

Initialization
Before beginning any application, it is recommended that all display settings be initialized. Below are
algorithms for initializing the display in both 8-bit and 4-bit communication modes.

Before the first wait condition, please allow Vcc to rise to 2.7V then wait 40ms. During the three
function set commands that follow, note that the busy flag cannot be checked; it becomes available in
the last block. The unit will always expect a total of 8 bits to be sent, so note the structure used in four
bit mode. The last initialization block will set the number of lines and character font as specified, turn
the display off, issue the display clear command, and finally set the entry mode as desired.

appropriate initialization algorithm. For 4-bit mode ensure D4-D7 are used. Finally, slow down
communication and refer to Timing Characteristics for proper control flow.
Test mode is initiated by connecting 2 and 3 pin of the 3pin connector CN2 before applying power. In
the test mode, a checker pattern is displayed across all characters of the screen. Please note that CN2
may be removed in the future.

e Operation outside absolute maximum ratings may cause permanent damage.

e Ensure Anti-Static handling procedures are followed. Store in an anti-static container within a
clean environment.

e Do not make extra holes on the display, modify its shape, or change the components. Do not
drop, bend, twist, or disassemble the display.

e Physical shock greater than 100G, thermal shock in excess of 10°C/minute, or a direct hit to the
glass display surface may crack the glass.

e Do not PUSH the display strongly. At mounting to the system frame, slight gap between display
glass face and front panel is necessary to avoid a contact failure of lead pins of display. Twist or
warp mounting will make a glass CRACK around the lead pin of display.

e Neither data nor power connectors should be connected or disconnected while power is
applied. Removal of primary power with logic signals applied may damage input circuitry.

e Power must be regulated completely since all control logic depends on this line. Do not apply
slow-start power. Provide sufficient power to supply inrush current at startup.

e Data cable length between module and host system is recommended within 300 mm to be free
from a miss-operation caused by noise.

e Running in test mode for 2 hours may help the stability of the brightness of them VFD when
power has not applied more than 2 months.

e Displaying a fixed (static) message longer than 5 hours in a day may cause the phosphor to burn-
out. An automatic shut down in programming, scrolling message, or test mode operation during
idling of the host is recommended.
