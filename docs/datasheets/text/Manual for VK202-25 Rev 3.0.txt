The VK202-25 is an intelligent alohanumeric liquid crystal display designed to decrease development
time by providing an instant solution to any project. In addition to the RS232, TTL and I2C protocols
available in the standard model, a USB communication model allow the VK202-25 to be connected to a
wide variety of host controllers. Communication speeds of up to 115.2kbps for serial protocols and
100kbps for I’C ensure lightning fast display updates.

The simple command structure permits easy software control of many settings including backlight
brightness, screen contrast, and baud rate. On board memory provides up to forty custom characters
which can be saved within the unit and recalled for start screens, bar graphs or larger numbers.

User input on the VK202-25 is available through a five by five matrix style keypad, and six general
purpose outputs provide simple switchable five volt sources. In addition, the option of a Dallas One-
Wire header provides a communication interface for up to thirty-two devices.

The versatile VK202-25, with all the features mentioned above, is available in a variety of colour,
voltage, and temperature options to suit almost any application.

2.2 Standard Module
The standard version of the VK202-25 allows for user configuration of three common communication
protocols. First, the unit can communicate using serial protocol at either RS323 or TTL voltage levels.
Second, it can communicate using the Inter-Integrated Circuit connect, or I?C protocol. Connections for
each protocol can be accessed through the four pin Communication/Power Header as outlined in the
Serial Connections and I’C Connections sections below.

Recommended Parts

——— The most common cable choice for any alphanumeric Matrix Orbital
7 ~ Display, the Communication/ Power Cable offers a simple connection
6 to the unit with familiar interfaces. DB9 and floppy power headers
provide all necessary input to drive your display.

For a more flexible interface to the VK202-25 a Breadboard Cable may
be used. This provides a simple four wire connection that is popular
among developers for its ease of use in a breadboard environment.

Serial Connections

A serial interface provides a classic connection to the VK202-25. The Communication/Power Cable is
most commonly used for this set up as it provides connections for DB9 serial and floppy power cables.
To place your board in Serial mode, adhere to the steps laid out below.

1. Set the Protocol Select jumpers.

e RS232: Connect the three jumpers* in the 232 protocol box with the zero ohm jumper resistors
provided or an alternate wire or solder solution.
e TTL: Connect the two jumpers* in the TTL protocol box.

*Note: Jumpers must be removed from all protocol boxes save for the one in use.
2. Make the connections.

a. Connect the four pin female header of the Communication/Power Cable to the
Communication/Power Header of your VK202-25.

b. Insert the male end of your serial cable to the corresponding DB9 header of the
Communication/Power Cable and the mate the female connector with the desired
communication port of your computer.

c. Select an unmodified floppy cable from a PC power supply and connect it to the power header
of the Communication/Power Cable.

3. Create.

Use uProject or a terminal program to get started, and then move on with your own
development. A number of application notes are available at www.matrixorbital.ca/appnotes.

 

A more advanced connection to the VK202-25 is provided by the I’C protocol setting. This is best

accomplished using a breadboard and the Breadboard Cable. Power must be supplied from your

breadboard or another external source. To dive right into your application and use the VK202-25 in I7C

mode, get started with the guidelines below.

1.

Set the Protocol Select switches.

I°C: Ensure that the two IC jumpers in the corresponding protocol box are connected while all
others are open.

Make the connections.

a. Connect the Breadboard Cable to the Communication/Power Header on your VK202-25 and
plug the four leads into your breadboard. The red lead will require power, while the black
should be connected to ground, and the green and yellow should be connected to your
controller clock and data lines respectively.

b. Pull up the clock and data lines to five volts using a resistance between one and ten kilohms on
your breadboard.

Create.

This time you're on your own. While there are many examples within the Matrix Orbital
AppNote section, www.matrixorbital.ca/appnotes, too many controllers and languages exist to

 

cover them all. If you get stuck in development, it is possible to switch over to another protocol
on the standard board, and fellow developers are always on our forums for additional support.
The VK202-25-USB offers a single USB protocol for an easy connection to a host computer. This simple
and widely available protocol can be accessed using the on board mini B style USB connector as outlined
in the USB Connections section.

The External Mini USB cable is recommended for the VK202-25-USB display.
| It will connect to the miniB style header on the unit and provide a
: 4 i | connection to a regular A style USB connector, commonly found ona PC.
¥ yf

The USB connection is the quickest, easiest solution for PC development. After driver installation, the
VK202-25-USB will be accessible through a virtual serial port, providing the same result as a serial setup
without the cable hassle. To connect to your VK202-25-USB please follow the steps below.

1. Set the Protocol Select jumpers.

e USB: The VK202-25-USB offers USB protocol only. Model specific hardware prevents this unit
from operating in any other protocol, and does not allow other models to operate in USB.
Protocol Select jumpers on the USB model cannot be moved.

2. Make the connections.

e Plug the mini-B header of your External Mini USB cable into your VK202-25-USB and the regular

USB header into your computer USB jack.
3. Install the drivers.

a. Download the latest drivers at www.matrixorbital.ca/drivers, and save them to a known
location.

b. When prompted, install the USB bus controller driver automatically

c. If asked, continue anyway, even though the driver is not signed
When the driver install is complete, your display will turn on, but communication will not yet be
possible.

e. Atthe second driver prompt, install the serial port driver automatically

f. Again, if asked, continue anyway

4. Create.

e Use uProject or a terminal program to get started, and then move on with your own

development. A number of application notes are available at www.matrixorbital.ca/appnotes.
3 Software

The multiple communication protocols available and simple command structure of the VK202-25 means
that a variety of applications can be used to communicate with the display. Text is sent to the display as
a character string, for example, sending the decimal value 41 will result in an 'A' appearing on the
screen. Anumber of control characters are also activated. Commands are merely values prefixed with a
special command byte, 254 in decimal.

Control Characters

8 Backspace 10 Linefeed/Newline 12 Clearscreen/Newpage 13 Carriage return

Once the correct communication port is identified, the following communication settings can be applied
to communicate correctly with the VK202-25.

|_BPS | Data Bits | Parity | Stop Bits | Flow Control |

19200 8 None 1 None

Finally, with a communication port identified and correctly setup simple text strings or even command
bytes can easily be transmitted to control your display.

3.1 uProject
The Matrix Orbital alohanumeric display tuner, or uProject, is offered as a free download from the
www.matrixorbital.ca support site. It allows the basic functionality of *any display to be tested using a
simple graphical user interface system.

While basic functionality can be tested using the GUI portion of the program, more advanced users will
enjoy the scripting capability found in the uploader tab. Here commands can be stacked, run, and saved
for later use. Although many commands are available to be dragged into the script dialog, perhaps the
most powerful is the raw data command found in the other branch.

*Note: The uProject AutoDetect function will not perform correctly when a USB display is connected. Please
manually configure any USB display.
This command allows raw bytes to be sent to the display, permitting many different formats for entry
and displaying in decimal notation. Any command from this manual may be entered in decimal notation
separated by slashes.

[254] /88/

Again, the clear screen command is sent to a connected display, this time using uProject raw data
command style. Scripts can be run as a whole using the execute command from the script menu, or as
single commands by selecting execute once. Before issuing commands, it is a good idea to ensure
communication with a display is successful using some of the more basic GUI functions in the main
window.

This program provides scratch pad upon which a tome of display projects and ideas can be assembled.

Full demonstration programs and code are available for Matrix Orbital Displays in the C# language from
Simple C# AppNote Pack in the Application Note section at www.matrixorbital.ca/appnotes. Difficulty

 

increases from beginner, with the Hello World program, to advanced with the Dallas One-Wire
temperature reading application.

Many additional applications are available in a number of different programming languages. These
programs are meant to showcase the capability of the display and are not intended to be integrated into
a final design. For additional information regarding code, please read the On Code document also found
on the support site.

The VK202-25 provides a DB-9 Connector to readily interface with serial devices using EIA232 standard
signal levels. It is also possible to communicate at TTL levels of 0 to +5V by setting the Protocol Select
Jumpers to TTL. As an added feature it is also possible to apply power through pin 9 of the DB-9
Connector in order to reduce cable clutter. A standard male DB9 header will provide the perfect mate
for this connector.

*Note: Do not apply voltage through pin 9 of the DB-9 Connector AND through the Communication/Power Header
at the same time.
Power Through DB9 Jumper

In order to provide power through pin 9 of the DB-9 Connector you must connect the Power Through
DB-9 Jumper labelled D, as illustrated below. This connection can be made using a zero ohm resistor,
recommended size 0603, or a solder bridge. The VK202-25 allows all voltage models to use the power
through DB-9 option, see the Voltage Specifications for power requirements.

Protocol Select Jumpers

The Protocol Select Jumpers provide the means necessary to toggle the VK202-25 between RS-232, TTL
and |?C protocols. As a default, the jumpers are set to RS-232 mode with solder jumps on the RS232
jumpers. In order to place the display module in I?C mode you must first remove the solder jumps from
the RS232 jumpers and then place them on the I’C jumpers. The display will now be in |2C mode and
have a default slave address of 80, unless changed with the appropriate command. Similarly, in order to
change the display to TTL mode, simply remove the zero ohm resistors from the RS232 or I?C jumpers
and solder them to the TTL jumpers.

To facilitate user input, the VK202-25 provides a Keypad Interface Connector which allows a matrix style
keypad of up to twenty-five keys to be directly connected to the display module. Key presses are
generated when a short is detected between a row and a column. When a key press is generated, a
character specific to that key press is automatically sent on the Tx communication line. If the display
module is running in I?C mode, the “Auto Transmit Keypress” function may be turned off to allow the
key presses to remain in the buffer so that they may be polled. The character that is associated with
each key press may also be altered using the “Assign Key Codes” command. The straight twelve pin
header of the Keypad Interface Connector will interface to a variety of different devices including the
Matrix Orbital KPP4x4 keypad.

*Note: The Ground / +5V pin is toggled by the jumper to the right of the keypad connector. Jump pads 1 & 2 for
+5V or 2 & 3 for GND.

In order for your VK202-25 to function correctly, it must be supplied with the appropriate power. Ifthe
screen is not illuminated, power may not be applied correctly. Try the tips below.

e First, make sure that you are using the correct power connector. Standard floppy drive power
cables from your PC power supply may fit on the Communication/Power Header; however they
do not have the correct pin out to provide power. Matrix Orbital supplies power cable adapters
for connecting to a PC, which can be found in the Accessories section.

e Next, check the power cable which you are using for continuity. If you don't have an ohm
meter, try using a different power cable, if this does not help try using a different power supply.

e If power is applied through the DB9 connector, ensure that the Power Through DB9 Jumper is
connected.

e If changes have been made to the protocol select block, ensure all the appropriate protocol
select jumpers are connected and all unused protocol jumpers are disconnected.

e The last step will be to check the interface connector in use on your display. If the power
connections have become loose, or you are unable to resolve the issue, please Contact Matrix
Orbital for more information.

 

If your display is powered successfully, the Matrix Orbital logo, or user created screen should display on
start up. If this is not the case, check out these tips.

e Ensure the contrast is not too high or too low. This can result in a darkened or blank screen
respectively. See the Manual Override section to reset to default.

e Make sure that the start screen is not blank. It is possible to overwrite the Matrix Orbital logo
start screen, if this happens the screen may be blank. Try writing to the display to ensure it is
functional, after checking the contrast above.
When communication of either text or commands is interrupted, try the steps below.

First, check the communication cable for continuity. If you don't have an ohm meter, try using a
different communication cable. If you are using a PC try using a different Com/USB Port.

Next, please ensure that the display module is set to communicate on the protocol that you are
using, by checking the Protocol Select Jumpers.

In serial and USB protocols, ensure that the host system and display module are both
communicating on the same baud rate. The default rate for the display module is 19200 bps.
Match Rx from your display to the transmitting pin from your host and the Tx pin to the
receiving pin.

If you are communicating to the display via I?C* please ensure that the data is being sent to the
correct address. The default slave address for the display module is 80.

In °C mode, connect Rx to the clock line of your controller and Tx to the data output.

Unlock the display. See the Set and Save Data Lock command for more info.

Finally, you may reset the display to its default settings using the Manual Override procedure
outlined below.

*Note: I?C communication will always require pull up resistors on SCL and SDA of one to ten kilohms.

Should the settings of your display become altered in a way that dramatically impacts usability, the
default settings can be temporarily restored. To override the display, please follow the steps below.

PWN RP

Disconnect power from your display.

Place a jumper on the middle two keypad pins, R5 and C1.

Reconnect power to your unit, and wait for the start screen before removing the jumper.

9 Definitions
ASCII: American standard code for information interchange used to give standardized numeric codes
to alphanumeric characters.

BPS: Bits per second, a measure of transmission speed.

DOW: Dallas One-Wire protocol, similar to °C, provides reduced data rates at a greater distance. One
wire carries data, while two others supply power and ground. Matrix Orbital tests non-parasitic devices
only, those that do not draw power from the data line; however, some parasitic devices may work.

FFSTN: Double film super-twisted nematic in reference to an LCD. The addition of two layers of film
between the STN display and polarizer improves contrast.

GPO: General purpose output, used to control peripheral devices from a display.
GUI: | Graphical user interface.
Hexadecimal: A base 16 number system utilizing symbols 0 through F to represent the values 0-15.

IC: Inter-integrated circuit protocol uses clock and data lines to communicate short distances at
slow speeds from a master to up to 128 addressable slave devices. A display is a slave device.

LSB: Least significant bit or byte in a transmission, the rightmost when read.
MSB: Most significant bit or byte in a transmission, the leftmost when read.
RS232: Recommended standard 232, a common serial protocol. A low level is -30V, a high is +30V.

SDA: _ Serial data line used to transfer data in I?C protocol. This open drain line should be pulled high
through a resistor. Nominal values are between 1K and 10K Q.

SCL: Serial clock line used to designate data bits in |7C protocol. This open drain line should be pulled
high through a resistor. Nominal values are between 1K and 10K QO.

STN: Super-twisted nematic in reference to an LCD. In a relaxed or nematic state, crystals orientate
themselves in the same direction and allow light to pass. In an excited state these crystals align to block
light. Super-twisted crystals move from 180 to 270 degrees providing greater contrast than TN models.

TTL: — Transistor-transistor logic applied to serial protocol. Low level is OV while high logic is 5V.
