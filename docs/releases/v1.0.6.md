# VFDDisplay v1.0.6 â€” 2025-09-28

Documentation update: hardware coverage and contributions.

Notes
- Only `VFD20S401HAL` has been validated on real hardware. Other HALs were implemented from datasheets and may need verification.
- Community testers are encouraged to try unverified HALs and report findings (issues/PRs welcome).
- The maintainer is willing to correct or add HALs for character-type VFDs when hardware is provided for testing.
- Graphics VFDs may be supported in a separate library if there is interest and hardware is supplied; character and graphics libraries will remain separate.

No code changes in this release.
